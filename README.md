# **MoonOS**

## Hello. So for an amount of time that i dont know i will no longer be updating MoonOS. For any questions please message Moona Loona#0001 on discord.

MoonOS is an operating system coded in batch. Obviously it's not an actually operating system because that's impossible but it's meant just to play around with.
If anybody could help me with MoonOS it would be greatly appreciated. Any suggestions for MoonOS you should dm me on discord at Moona Loona#0001.

If you want your custom user onto the official MoonOS, please dm me on discord at Moona Loona#0001.

### How to create custom users
First go to ```root\files``` then edit ```login.bat```. Then scroll down until you see something like ```if %username%==admin goto verify-admin``` copy that and put it under. Then after the ```%username%==``` put your username. After that you should see a  ```goto verify-admin``` change that admin to your username again. Then scroll down until you see stuff like ```:verify-admin``` and then copy one of them and go 1 line under one of them and paste it. Then at the colon write ```verify-``` then after the dash/hyphen put your username. Then you should see ```set username=``` delete whatever is after ```username=``` and put your username again. Then under that you should see ```if %pass%==3412 goto desktop``` change that ```3412``` to your password and do that same thing for the one below it. Now you should have your own user. If this failed, please dm me on discord at Moona Loona#0001
