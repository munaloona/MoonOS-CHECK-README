## Anyone is allowed to use MoonOS in any way.

MoonOS is an operating system coded in batch. Obviously it's not an actually operating system because that's impossible but it's meant just to play around with.
If anybody could help me with MoonOS it would be greatly appreciated. Any suggestions for MoonOS you should dm me on discord Moona Loona#0001.

### TUTORIALS----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To create a new user in MoonOS, go into files > system > tut and copy the user template inside to the users folder in files > users . After doing so, left click and right click on login.bat and click on edit at the top then scroll down to the bottom until you see :verif1 and/or :verif2. Copy the whole thing of :verif2 and go 2 lines under it and paste it. Then make it something like :verif3. Now, in the "if %pass%==loona goto desktop" (and also in the one under it) change "loona" to your user account password (can be anything you want.). Then after that go to above it where it says "if %username%==moona goto verif2" copy that and put it 1 line under. Then make "moona" your user account username and change verif2 to whatever you named what we copied before. Then the one under it ("if not %username%==moona goto login") copy that 1 line under it and change "moona" to your user account username. If it doesn't work retry it and/or dm me on discord Moona Loona#0001
